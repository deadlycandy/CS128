The lab is functional and meets deisred specifications during our local testing. 

Local testing was done by creating multiple docker instances on the same computer, each with their own ip_port configuration
(based on the ip of the machine). To ensure the system worked we used the test conditions given within the test script. 

However we ran into 2 main issues. 
1. While developing the lab certain networks would not allow us to test on. For example when I (Rahil) would switch from eduroam to my 
   personal wifi, the docker instances would stop communicating. By the end of the lab this problem occured on the eduroam network as well. 

2. Running the test scripts, resulted in failure of operations we knew to work (as per our local testing findings).
