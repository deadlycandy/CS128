To test the program please use the included test script. test_HW2.py is a derivative of the test script posted on Github. 
Changes made:
1. Changed json message/keys to match piazza specifcations.
   E.G. changing the 'error' key in test_HW2 to 'results'.
2. Streamlined json message/keys presented in test_HW2 but not defined on piazza post to match piazza post format. 
3. Added an additional unit test to test if a node is down. (Used code provided on piazza post).
4. Added print statments to show response data (final version commented out)
5. Used python 2.7
