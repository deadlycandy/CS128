This project passes test 3/5 tests. We encountered timeout issues on test two.
Which we narrowed down to the ip_port combination causing the timeout. The remove node
test failed due to a 500. I could not narrow the issue with delete view (worked previously).

Here are a the things I changed a few thing in the hw4_test.py

This originally was checking the len of shard however shard is just a key

def test_c_shard_no_lonely_nodes(self):
    ipPort = self.view[0]["testScriptAddress"]

    shardView = self.getShardView(ipPort)
    for shard in shardView:
        length = len(shardView[shard])
        self.assertTrue(length > 1)
